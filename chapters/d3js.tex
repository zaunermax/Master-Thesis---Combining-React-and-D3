\section{Introduction to D3}

\emph{D3} is a \emph{JavaScript} library that helps developers create highly sophisticated data visualizations on the web via a universal tool that is platform agnostic: the browser. The official documentation of \emph{D3} in~\cite{D3Website} explains the library as a toolkit that allows binding data to the DOM. The documentation also provides an overview of the vast amount of helpful tools that can be used to visualize data in the browser. The library includes all kinds of functionality, ranging from simple array and mathematic operations to complex simulations that are calculated in real time.

One of the most popular features of \emph{D3} is to render user interactable animated charts. Not only is it possible to easily create a bar chart, for instance, but all other kinds of charts as well. A full list of available packages is available online in~\cite{D3Github}. The library is prevalent amongst data scientists as it is quite easy to create complex data visualizations in the web quickly.

\emph{D3} also provides some other utility functions that can be useful in many use-cases. There is, for example, a module that calculates chromatic colors for charts to get colors that have the maximum diversity to each other to be easily distinguishable as seen in \emph{D3's} documentation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic}}. Another example of the documentation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/d3/d3-array}} shows that the library also provides some useful array manipulating functions which come in handy when having to deal with big data sets. Also, generating random numbers via various distributions is no problem when using the d3-random package\footnote{\url{https://github.com/d3/d3-random}}. The list of useful data manipulation tools goes on, and dealing with every aspect of the library would go far beyond the scope of this thesis. 

What makes \emph{D3} unique is the possibility to create individual data structures for rendering sophisticated data visualizations. The library provides scatter plots\footnote{\url{https://github.com/d3/d3-scale}} or pie charts, line charts, area charts, radial bar charts, tree maps\footnote{\url{https://github.com/d3/d3-shape}} to name a few. \emph{D3} also provides utility functions to add labels or user interaction to every mentioned but also not mentioned data visualization type. A sig\-nifi\-cant benefit of using \emph{D3} is that it provides simple methods to transform any \emph{D3} visualization into being user interactable by creating floating tooltips and sliders, switches, or knobs, which control the visualization.

Due to the immense size of the library and its many data manipulation tools, \emph{D3} is divided into different sub-modules to prevent users of the library having to download the full library code bundle in the browser to be able to use the library.~\cite{D3Github} shows a full list of every available tool that can be used in composition with the base package of \emph{D3}. When using \emph{D3} in a big production project, every available \emph{D3} module can be integrated into any project by using the package manager \emph{npm}\footnote{\url{https://www.npmjs.com/}} via downloading it from its registry\footnote{\url{https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=d3}}.

There are multiple examples on the documentation's example page in~\cite{D3Examples} which show what developers can achieve by using the \emph{D3} library.

\section{Explaining the D3 API} 

This section aims to discuss the most vital aspects of the \emph{D3} API to understand code samples that are presented in later chapters. Some general knowledge of \emph{D3's} API is of utmost importance as the knowledge is crucial for understanding the comparisons of \emph{React} and \emph{D3} in chapter~\ref{cha:visualization}. As mentioned before, the \emph{D3} API mostly consists of consecutive chained imperative function calls that not only manipulate the visualization and its data but also bind the data to the DOM.~\cite[p.\ 625]{prgLngDesignImpl} describes the imperative programming pattern as a static division of a program into its concurrent tasks which means that the programmer uses statements to change the programs state. 

According to the documentation in~\cite{D3Github} the library \emph{D3} was created in 2010. Thus it can be noticed that the API of the library originates from a time, where developers did not even think about using \emph{JavaScript} in productive or even enterprise environments. Therefore, large codebases written with \emph{D3} tend to be hardly scalable and difficult to maintain. Multiple instruction function calls in program~\ref{prog:d3selection} show that \emph{D3} code is indeed imperative. Also, the library makes use of a software pattern called "chaining". The pattern works because each function returns an instance of itself to enable the addition of an infinite amount of functions that can be added to the chain.

\begin{program}
\caption{\emph{D3} selection, enter, and exit example.}
\label{prog:d3selection}
\begin{JsCode}
// earlier in the script

const svg = d3.select('.container')  
const node = svg.selectAll('.node')

// handling data changes of the simulation

node
  .exit() /+\label{line:exitSel}+/
  .style('fill', '#b26745')
  .transition(t)
  .attr('r', 1e-6)
  .remove()

node
  .transition(t) /+\label{line:d3Transition}+/
  .style('fill', '#3a403d')
  .attr('r', (node) => node.size)

node
  .enter() /+\label{line:enterSel}+/
  .append('circle')
  .style('fill', '#45b29d') /+\label{line:styleCall}+/
  .attr('r', (node) => node.size) /+\label{line:computed1}+/
  .attr('id', (node) => node.name) /+\label{line:computed2}+/
\end{JsCode}
\end{program}

\begin{program}
\caption{Negative example of how confusing and unmaintainable \emph{D3} code can become.}
\label{prog:d3confusing}
\begin{JsCode}
d3.select(_this).classed('active', true)
d3.select(_this)
  .select('.circle')
  .transition(500)
  .attr('stroke', function(d) {
    if (d.rings && d.rings.length > 0) return '#404348'
    return d.color || COLORS[d.type.toUpperCase()] || '#27292c'
  })
  .attr('fill', function(d) {
    return '#404348'
  })
  .style('filter', 'drop-shadow(0 3px 4.7px rgba(0,0,0,.54))')
d3.select(_this)
  .selectAll('.ring')
  .transition(500)
  .attr('opacity', 1)
d3.select(_this)
  .selectAll('.node-background')
  .transition(500)
  .attr('opacity', 0)
d3.select(_this)
  .selectAll('.sub-circle')
  .transition(500)
  .attr('cx', function(d, i) {
    let deg = ((Math.PI * 2) / 8) * i - Math.PI
    let x = Math.sin(deg)
    let offset = event.rings ? event.rings.length * 15 : 0
    return x * (d.r + 5 + offset)
  })
  .attr('cy', (d, i) => {
    let deg = ((Math.PI * 2) / 8) * i - Math.PI
    let y = Math.cos(deg)
    let offset = event.rings ? event.rings.length * 15 : 0
    return y * (d.r + 5 + offset)
  })
  .attr('stroke', '#FFF')
\end{JsCode}
\end{program}

Selecting DOM nodes and creating a \emph{D3} selection model is a vital aspect of \emph{D3's} API. Via selection \emph{D3} can connect \emph{JavaScript} application data to actual DOM nodes as~\cite{D3Github} shows. An example can be seen in the code example in program~\ref{prog:d3selection}. Because the library is imperative each node that is added or removed is handled via a chained function call as the append function in program~\ref{prog:d3selection} shows very well. When adding or removing multiple DOM nodes and the individual nodes of the simulation are complicated DOM structures, the code quickly gets very incomprehensive as demonstrated in program~\ref{prog:d3confusing}. The provided code example in program~\ref{prog:d3selection} showcases a simple append operation of a single circle element, for instance, in comparison to the much more complex example in program~\ref{prog:d3confusing}. 

Not only is it possible to select DOM nodes via \emph{D3} but the library also contains the feature of selecting entering and exiting nodes as lines~\ref{line:exitSel} and~\ref{line:enterSel} showcase in program~\ref{prog:d3selection}. The enter and exit selection function calls can be used to explicitly handle nodes that enter and exit the visualiization according to the data that is bound to the DOM. The chained function calls can then handle the enter and exit selections accordingly. Line~\ref{line:enterSel} in program~\ref{prog:d3selection} shows an enter selection which appends a circle SVG element for each new data object and also applies various attributes and style.

When the data of a visualization changes, nodes might be deleted, new nodes might appear but nodes might also stay in the visualization but change their position. \emph{D3} covers these use-cases by including the possibility to add transitions to node selections. The transition feature lets developers specify how to handle DOM elements that stay in the visualization when the data is updated. Advanced animations and transitions can be added via a simple function call. 

For example, line~\ref{line:exitSel} in program~\ref{prog:d3selection} shows a selection where all nodes are selected that are removed after the data has changed. Furthermore, the color is changed and a transition effect is added, which transforms the radius attribute of the node until it reaches the specified amount. Finally the node is then removed completely from the DOM resulting in a nice animation of the node exiting the visualization.

The code in program~\ref{prog:d3selection} also clearly shows that every attribute and style instruction of added DOM nodes has to be handled via a chained function call. On line~\ref{line:styleCall} in program~\ref{prog:d3selection} the \texttt{fill} property is added to the \texttt{<circle>} SVG element. Each additional style property would require a consecutive call of the \texttt{style(`property', [style])} function.

Also, a key component of \emph{D3's} API is the possibility to pass attribute handling functions instead of hardcoded values. Those computed properties can be found in lines~\ref{line:computed1} and~\ref{line:computed2} in program~\ref{prog:d3selection}. By passing a function to property or attribute setters like the \texttt{.style(`attribute', [style])} method, the passed handler is called by \emph{D3} as a callback by providing each node's data to the callback. Therefore, when rendering 10 nodes, the attribute function on line~\ref{line:computed1} in program~\ref{prog:d3selection} which sets the radius of the node would be called 10 times, setting the radius for each specific node individually.

The code example in program~\ref{prog:d3confusing} is taken from production code and shows how hard to read \emph{D3} code can become if multiple DOM changes have to be handled imperatively. Not only the addition of the nodes has to be handled via function calls, but also some general node properties like CSS styles or custom attributes.

Over the years better software patterns emerged and experience shows that chaining is a software pattern that was new at the time but can cause code that is hard to maintain. Nowadays this library would probably be written with a functional approach, letting developers compose their simulations via functional composition as various libraries and frameworks on the internet already do. 

The problem with the example in program~\ref{prog:d3selection} is that the code cannot be reused, as it is hardcoded into a chain. Nowadays many frameworks for building front end applications use a declarative approach for binding the view to the data model. More information about declarative approaches can be found in chapter~\ref{cha:react}. \emph{D3's} API still uses the imperative software pattern which forces developers to chain library function statements to control multiple elements in the DOM.

%Chaining is not the only problem that might decrease the code quality of a project. The other problem of D3 is, %that handling DOM nodes is not declarative but imperative code as well.

\section{Force Graphs -- Real Time Rendered Data Visualizations}

Due to the immense size of \emph{D3}, the focus of this thesis and its project lies on a rather "small" but quite important part of the library -- the force graph simulation. It is the graph type that was integrated into \emph{React} during the implementation phase of the thesis project. The visualizations consist of objects that interact with each other in a two-dimensional space. By interacting and moving objects all other objects in the animation are also affected. 

Figures~\ref{fig:force001} and~\ref{fig:force002} show an example of \emph{D3's} force simulation. In figure~\ref{fig:force001} there is a single center force that drags all nodes towards the center but also prevents individual nodes from overlapping each other. Force graphs can also be configured to make nodes reject each other even further than their actual size as figure~\ref{fig:force004} shows. It is also possible to implement so-called links that also add some complexity to the simulation, as nodes are dependent on each other and not only reject each other but also attract linked nodes as figures~\ref{fig:force002} and~\ref{fig:force005} show.

As previously mentioned, all force simulations are calculated, animated, and rendered in the browser which also includes user interaction. The user can, for example, drag nodes around which of course affects other nodes and the whole simulation as well. Figure~\ref{fig:force003} shows well, how dragging one node affects the whole force graph, as all connected nodes follow the dragged node while still rejecting each other and while being attracted to the center force.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\columnwidth]{forceOwn002.PNG}
  \caption{A sample force graph where the top node is dragged up to the left and the other nodes are dragged along. The force keeps the other nodes apart but also draws them to the center.}
  \label{fig:force003}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{forceOwn003.PNG}
  \caption{A sample force graph with one center force. The nodes are configured to reject each other with the function \texttt{r+r/2}.}
  \label{fig:force004}
\end{figure}

\emph{D3} provides a somewhat simplified API to be able to quickly implement force graphs\footnote{\url{https://github.com/d3/d3-force}} in the browser. The way force simulations work is that developers first have to define or build the simulation. There is a factory method as seen in line~\ref{line:forceBuild} of program~\ref{prog:simulation} which takes the nodes of the graph as an argument and builds a default simulation. The nodes have to be provided in a particular scheme\footnote{\url{https://github.com/d3/d3-force\#simulation_nodes}} so \emph{D3} can correctly parse the node array. 

\begin{program}
\caption{Code snippets for \emph{D3} force simulation code.}
\label{prog:simulation}
\begin{JsCode}
simulation.forceSimulation([nodes]) // factory method for a standard force simulation
simulation.tick([iterations]) // called on every tick the simulation goes through /+\label{line:manualTick}+/
simulation.start() // starts a stopped simulation /+\label{line:d3ForceStart}+/
simulation.stop() // stops a started simulation /+\label{line:d3ForceStop}+/
simulation.restart() // restarts a simuliation, resets alpha /+\label{line:d3ForceRestart}+/
simulation.alpha([alpha]) // directly sets alpha value /+\label{line:d3ForceAlphaSet}+/
simulation.alphaTarget([alphaTarget]) // sets alpha target value /+\label{line:d3ForceAlphaTarget}+/
simulation.alphaMin([min]) // sets minimum alpha value /+\label{line:d3ForceAlphaMin}+/
\end{JsCode}
\end{program}

\begin{program}
\caption{Sample initialization of a \emph{D3} force graph.}
\label{prog:d3forceinit}
\begin{JsCode}
const simulation = forceSimulation(data) /+\label{line:forceBuild}+/
  .force('charge', forceManyBody().strength(-150))
  .force('forceX', forceX().strength(0.1))
  .force('forceY', forceY().strength(0.1))
  .force('center', forceCenter())
  .alphaTarget(1)
  .on('tick', ticked)
\end{JsCode}
\end{program}

Another very important aspect of force graphs is the so called "alpha" value system\footnote{\url{https://github.com/d3/d3-force\#forces}}, which controls how long the simulation is active. The alpha value is a gradually decaying value that makes the simulation stop if a certain value is reached. Every simulation's tick handling function is called every "tick" of the simulation. Also, every time a "tick" is executed the alpha value decays via a predefinable function, it happens logarithmically per default tough. The tick handling function is not only called every tick but also for each individual node. It receives every node position in the simulation which lets developers link the data to the DOM with \emph{D3} again. Knowing about the tick function is very important later on when the combination of \emph{D3} and \emph{React} is explained in more detail. Program~\ref{prog:d3forceinit} is a simple example that shows how to initialize a \emph{D3} force simulation.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{forceOwn001.PNG}
  \caption{A sample force graph where some nodes are linked together while still rejecting each other.}
  \label{fig:force005}
\end{figure}

If there is a user interaction, the simulation sometimes has to be restarted or reheated. Programmers can set alpha values and targets to reheat or restart the simulation in case a node is dragged by the user which would possibly require many other nodes in the simulation to react to that user input. That way also the speed of the simulation can be controlled via setting a custom decay function. \emph{D3's} documentation about force simulations\footnote{\url{https://github.com/d3/d3-force}} points to a few methods that can achieve said functionality. The functions on line~\ref{line:d3ForceStart},~\ref{line:d3ForceStop}, and~\ref{line:d3ForceRestart} of program~\ref{prog:simulation} can be used to reheat a simulation. Also the functions in line~\ref{line:d3ForceAlphaSet},~\ref{line:d3ForceAlphaTarget}, and~\ref{line:d3ForceAlphaMin} of program~\ref{prog:simulation} can be used to set values directly to alter the simulation's life span.

\begin{program}
\caption{\emph{D3} written in a fictional functional way.}
\label{prog:d3functional}
\begin{JsCode}
const forceParams = compose(
  force('charge', pipe(forceManyBody(), strength(-150))),
  force('forceX', pipe(forceX(), strength(0.1))),
  force('forceY', pipe(forceY(), strength(0.1))),
  force('center', forceCenter()),
)

const simulation = compose(
  forceParams,
  alphaTarget(1),
  on('tick', ticked),
  forceSimulation
)(data)
\end{JsCode}
\end{program}

If a functional approach would be used the code from program~\ref{prog:d3forceinit} would look more like in example~\ref{prog:d3functional}. The difference between the two code examples in programs~\ref{prog:d3forceinit} and~\ref{prog:d3functional} might appear to be very subtle, but in reality, it is very sig\-nifi\-cant. By looking closer, it is clear that the variable \texttt{forceParams} is a functional composition of methods that can be reused multiple times in the application. In the first example in program~\ref{prog:d3forceinit} the simulation configuration is locked in the function chain. Chaining is a pattern which can easily cause duplicated code in any codebase. 

Writing functional \emph{D3} code could also alleviate the confusing unmaintainable code in program~\ref{prog:d3confusing} as developers can easily compose repeating DOM manipulation sequences and reuse them throughout the codebase without having to touch code on multiple files in case there is a bug that effects multiple aspects of the application.
